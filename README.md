### 🤔 Common Issues

- Crankshaft is incompatible with Decky Loader. If you are using Crankshaft, please uninstall it before installing Decky Loader.

- If you are using any software that uses port 1337 or 8080, please change its port to something else or uninstall it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Now that you have Decky Loader installed, you can start using plugins. Each plugin is maintained by a different developer and has its own uses, but most follow a general structure outlined below.

### 📦 Plugins

1. Press the <img src="./docs/images/light/qam.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/qam.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> button and navigate to the <img src="./docs/images/light/plug.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/plug.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> icon. This is the Decky menu used for interacting with plugins and the loader itself.
1. Select the <img src="./docs/images/light/store.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/store.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> icon to open the Plugins Browser. This is where you can find and install plugins.
   - You can also install from URL in the Settings menu. We do not recommend installing plugins from untrusted sources.
1. To install a plugin, select the "Install" button on the plugin you want. You can also select a version from a dropdown menu, but this is not recommended.
1. To update, uninstall, and reload plugins, navigate to the Decky menu and select the <img src="./docs/images/light/gear.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/gear.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> icon.
   - Keep in mind that uninstalling a plugin will only remove its plugin files, not any other files it may have created.

### 🛠️ Plugin Development

There is no complete plugin development documentation yet. However a good starting point is the [plugin template repository](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-plugin-template). Consider [joining our Discord](https://discord.gg/ZU74G2NJzk) if you have any questions.

### 🤝 Contributing

Please consult [the wiki page regarding development](https://deckbrew.xyz/en/loader-dev/development) for more information on installing development versions of Decky Loader. You can also install the Steam Deck UI on a Windows or Linux computer for testing by following [this YouTube guide](https://youtu.be/1IAbZte8e7E?t=112).

1. Clone the repository using the latest commit to main before starting your PR.
1. In your clone of the repository, run these commands.
   ```bash
   pnpm i
   pnpm run build
   ```
1. If you are modifying the UI, these commands will need to be run before deploying the changes to your Steam Deck.
1. Use the VS Code tasks or `deck.sh` script to deploy your changes to your Steam Deck to test them.
1. You will be testing your changes with the Python script version. You will need to build, deploy, and reload each time.

⚠️ If you are receiving build errors due to an out of date library, you should run this command inside of your repository.

```bash
pnpm update decky-frontend-lib --latest
```

Source control and deploying plugins are left to each respective contributor for the cloned repos in order to keep dependencies up to date.

## 📜 Credits

The original idea for the plugin loader concept is based on the work of [marios8543's Steam Deck UI Inject project](https://github.com/marios8543/steamdeck-ui-inject).
